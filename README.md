CatMood

CatMood is a JavaScript project that generates images or GIFs based on the chosen mood. In this project, users can select their current mood, and the application will display pictures or GIFs of different cats that match the selected mood. Whether you're feeling happy, sad, excited, or calm, "CatMood" has the purrfect companion for you! Developed during my coursework on the Scrimba platform, this project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a delightful and interactive experience for cat lovers.
